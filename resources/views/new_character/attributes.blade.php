                                <p>A measure of your character's physical strength and muscle power.
                                    Characters with a high Strength probably spent a lot of time in the gym
                                    in high school. This statistic is used in the secondary
                                    statistics Carry Weight and Melee Damage. All weapons have a minimum Strength
                                    requirement as well. Rolls against Strength are used when characters try to break doors down,
                                    bend the bars on their prison cell, and do other feats that require sheer muscle power.</p>

                                    a "normal" picture. Perceptive characters tend to be able to read another person's reactions,
                                    and can even tell when another person is lying. This statistic is used in the Sequence secondary
                                    statistic, and in several skills such as Lockpick, Traps, First Aid, and Doctor. The primary
                                    use of this statistic is to determine the maximum distance your character can shoot a ranged
                                    weapon effectively.</p>

                                    statistics are based on Endurance, which also modifies a character's Survival skills.
                                    Rolls against Endurance determine things like whether your character can hang on to that
                                    rope over a canyon, or can resist the deadly cloud of bacteria some renegade scientist
                                    just sprayed in his or her face.</p>

                                    and how adept they are at knowing exactly what to say and do in social situations.
                                    No secondary statistics are based on Charisma.
                                    It heavily influences the Barter and Speech skills.
                                    Rolls against Charisma are made when a character is attempting to schmooze past
                                    some guards or trying to pick someone up in a bar.</p>

                                <p>Intelligence is a character's higher reasoning power. No secondary statistics are based on intelligence. Many of the non-combat skills use it for
                                    their base values, however. Intelligence also determines the number of skill points your
                                    character gains each level. Rolls against Intelligence are made when characters are
                                    attempting to guess a password or determine the pattern sequence of electric charges
                                    running through the pattern on the floor.</p>

                                <p>Agility measures the speed of a character's reactions. This statistic is the
                                    basis for the Armor Class and Action Point secondary statistics. It modifies the greatest
                                    number of skills as well, especially combat skills. Rolls against Agility are made when your
                                    character dodges a poison dart trap or attempts to jerk his arm out of the sewer before a
                                    mutated rat bites it off.</p>

                                    skills. Rolls against Luck are made at the GM's discretion; Luck rolls can determine if,
                                    when your character is out of ammo and lying half-unconscious on the ground, he happens to
                                    find that loaded shotgun lying concealed and forgotten in the dust.</p>
